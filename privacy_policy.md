Data Security and Retention 
---------------------------

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. For example, the Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data you provide to us. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. 

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally. 

Personal Data of Children
-------------------------

As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data about children under 13 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at <help@lvn.org>.  

We may collect Personal Data from children under 18; if that data is shared by their parent or legal guardian and in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 18 without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian, except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain parental consent (“Required Information”). Until we have received parental consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining parental consent. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 18, without parental or legal guardian consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child that has used LVN, or if you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at <help@lvn.org>.

If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.  

### Exercising Your Rights 

To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, including your email address used for lvn.org and the date and location of the conversation you participated in (if applicable) and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it.

We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request. 

We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request. 

You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
