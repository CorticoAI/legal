## Will Cortico ever change this Privacy Policy?

We're constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well. Any changes to the policy will be reflected on this "Privacy Policy" page.

## What Information does Cortico Collect?

#### Information You Provide to Us (Personally Identifying Information)

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. Personally identifying information may include, but is not limited to, information such as your name, email address, phone number, credit or debit card information, job application information, resumes and cover letters. Cortico collects Personally Identifying Information when you submit such information in the course of the use of our Services; for example, by filling out a job application or signing up for an email distribution list.

It is your choice to provide us with Personally Identifying Information. You should not provide it about yourself unless you are comfortable doing so, and you should not provide it about others unless expressly authorized to do so.

We may receive Personally Identifying Information about you from other sources, including your employer, professional references, publicly-available sources, third party analytics providers, and other third parties--for example, if someone at your place of employment lists you as a contact person.

For example, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, location, gender, race, languages, age, email address and phone number in addition to the recording of your voice and likeness and the content of any recording.

We may communicate with you if you've provided us the means to do so. For example, if you've given us your email address, we may email you about your use of the Services of send you informational updates about Cortico projects.

#### Information Collected Automatically

Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, "cookie" information, the type of browser and/or device you're using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.

If you click on a link to a third-party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Personal Information Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren't responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please beaware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor "Do Not Track" requests you have set using your browser or device.

We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services -- for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.

#### Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy

Some websites may choose to embed LVN content on their site via an interactive widget. In this case, we may collect information about your online activity while interacting with our services on a third-party website. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Personal Information Policy.

Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your onlinea ctivities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.
